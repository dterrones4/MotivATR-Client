App Overview
============

Motvatr allows user to be held accountable for fitness goals by texting a designated "MotivATR" when fitness goals
are met or fitness goals are not completed by a designated time.
Fitness progress is measured by fitbit data that is imported when a user signs into their fitbit account from the app.

After a user registers a new account and logs in they will be asked to authorize their fitbit account. The link takes the user
to fitbit.com and after they log in they will be redirected back to the site.
